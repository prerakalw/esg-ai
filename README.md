# ESG Implementation Agent

An AI-powered solution for guiding organizations through their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) journey using the Crew AI framework and locally hosted Language Models.

## Overview

The ESG Implementation Agent is a comprehensive multi-agent system that helps organizations implement and manage their ESG programs. It covers the entire ESG journey, from initial assessment to continuous improvement, using specialized AI agents to handle different aspects of the implementation process.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Four specialized agents work together to guide the ESG implementation process:
    - ESG Assessment Specialist
    - ESG Strategy Developer
    - ESG Implementation Manager
    - ESG Monitoring and Reporting Specialist

- **Complete ESG Journey Coverage**:
    - **Assessment**: Scope definition, stakeholder analysis, materiality assessment, data collection
    - **Strategy Development**: Goal setting, action planning, business integration
    - **Implementation**: Initiative execution, stakeholder engagement, capacity building
    - **Monitoring and Reporting**: Performance tracking, report creation, assurance, continuous improvement

- **ESG Data Management**: Structured models for organizing all ESG-related data:
    - ESG vision and goals
    - Stakeholder profiles and analysis
    - Material ESG issues
    - ESG metrics and KPIs
    - Action plans and initiatives
    - ESG reports

- **Tools and Utilities**:
    - Data collection and analysis
    - Stakeholder prioritization
    - Materiality assessment
    - Report generation
    - Data visualization

## Usage

### Project Structure

```
esg_implementation/
├── __init__.py       # Package initialization and exports
├── __main__.py      # Command-line interface
├── agents.py        # ESG implementation agents
├── core.py          # Core functionality and utilities
├── models.py        # Data models for ESG entities
├── tasks.py         # Task definitions for each phase
└── tools.py         # Tools for ESG implementation
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from esg_implementation import run_esg_implementation

# Run the ESG implementation process for an organization
result = run_esg_implementation("Your Organization Name")
```

### Using Components

```python
from esg_implementation import (
    ESGOrganization,
    ESGVision,
    Stakeholder,
    MaterialIssue,
    ESGMetric,
    ESGAction
)

# Load or create an organization
org = ESGOrganization.load_from_json("examples/greentech_solutions_esg_data.json")

# Create a new ESG vision
vision = ESGVision(
    description="To be a leader in sustainable business practices",
    timeframe="2024-2030",
    objectives=[
        "Achieve carbon neutrality by 2030",
        "Increase diversity in leadership by 50%",
        "Implement comprehensive ESG reporting"
    ]
)

# Add stakeholders
org.stakeholders.append(
    Stakeholder(
        name="Investors",
        category="Financial",
        interests=["ESG performance", "Risk management"],
        influence_level=0.9
    )
)

# Save updates
org.save_to_json()

### Generate Sample Data

```python
# Run the sample data generator
python sample_data_generator.py
```

This will create three sample organization files:
- `greentech_solutions_esg_data.json`: Complete ESG profile
- `eco_manufacturing_esg_data.json`: Organization in assessment phase
- `techinnovate_esg_data.json`: Organization in strategy phase

## Sample Data

The repository includes sample data for three organizations at different stages of their ESG journey:

### GreenTech Solutions
- Complete ESG profile with vision, stakeholders, material issues, metrics, and actions
- Ready for all phases of ESG implementation

### Eco Manufacturing Inc.
- Early assessment phase
- Limited to basic stakeholder information

### TechInnovate
- Strategy development phase
- Includes vision, stakeholders, and material issues
- No action plans yet

## Customization

### Using Different LLMs

The default configuration uses the Llama3 model through Ollama. To use a different model:

```python
# In esg_implementation_agent.py
from langchain.llms import Ollama

# Change to a different locally hosted model
llm = Ollama(model="mistral")

# Or use a different LLM provider (requires additional setup)
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
llm = OpenAI(api_key="your-api-key")
```

### Adding Custom Tools

You can extend the agent's capabilities by adding custom tools:

```python
from langchain.tools import BaseTool

class CustomESGTool(BaseTool):
    name = "custom_esg_tool"
    description = "Description of what your tool does"
    
    def _run(self, input_data):
        # Tool implementation
        return "Result from custom tool"
    
    async def _arun(self, input_data):
        return self._run(input_data)

# Add to an agent
custom_agent = Agent(
    role="Custom ESG Agent",
    goal="Your agent's goal",
    backstory="Your agent's backstory",
    verbose=True,
    llm=llm,
    tools=[CustomESGTool()]
)
```
